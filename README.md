[App here:](https://stupefied-morse-5e1233.netlify.com/)
Currently still using Firebase.

### Status

Structure set up and organized, now functionality is being built. 

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

It's spun up and working with passportjs for authorization. 

### What isn't working

- Everything that *should* working, is.

## Where are we?

### Working (not feature complete, full design still in progress):

- Server runs and connects to MongoDB 
- User registration
- User Register/Login/logout
- CSRF, Helmet working
- Email Verification (register and login)

### Not Working

### Working on Now:

- password resets

### To Come:

- Schema Creation
- Recipe CRUD
- Recipe Search
- Testing
- Full Documentation
- User Admin (update/delete)
- Passportjs linked code refactor - ensure proper structure and only needed config values (Config pains - went through numerous versions)
- Functional testing
- Pentesting
- Documentation
- Google/Facebook login (maybe)

## Built With

- Expressjs
